#+TITLE: Experiments

* Masking
** Allow streaming dataset in the model
*** Is there any specific use case for this?
** Test cheap linear models on masked datasets
** Compare masks with AEs
** Use full color CIFAR
** Generate and plot class specific masks
** Questions to answer
*** Can I use the masked representation of datasets to create `Minimal training set`?
*** Can this minimal training set network work with full data?
* Filter generation
** To add:
*** Normalization strategy
    - Normalizing the generator weights by some batch norm kind of thing
    - Normalizing the generated weights
*** Strategy to prevent local minima
** Image classification
*** MNIST:
    - 92% on val, having two ppconv layers, with 1 dense layer in the end.
* Output generation
